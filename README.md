# Internship-Project

We have created a simple GraphQL, Apollo-Server and NodeJS API for user registration.
To start program, open project and follow these steps:
1 -> Open terminal
2 -> npm init -y
3 -> npm pkg set type="module"
4 -> npm install @Apollo/Server graphql

When you have done all of these, type node index to run server on localhost, port 4000.
